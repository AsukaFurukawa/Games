This repository is dedicated to various game projects that serve as both learning experiences and entertainment. The games are implemented using Python, primarily utilizing the Turtle graphics library for 2D graphics.

## Projects

### 1. Pong
- A classic two-player Pong game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. 
- **Controls**: 
  - Player 1: `W` (up) and `S` (down)
  - Player 2: `Up Arrow` (up) and `Down Arrow` (down)

### 2. Snake Game
### Overview
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail. The game provides a simple yet engaging experience, perfect for honing your programming skills.
- ### Features

### 3. Tetris Game
### Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Python and the Pygame library. Players control falling Tetrominoes, rotating them and attempting to fill rows to clear them from the board. The objective is to keep the Tetrominoes from stacking to the top of the game area.
- ### Features
  - Classic Tetris gameplay mechanics.
  - Control Tetrominoes using arrow keys.
  - Line clearing and scoring system.
  - Game over condition when pieces reach the top.
